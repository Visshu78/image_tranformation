# 🐶🐱 Image Augmentation & Visualization with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to load, augment, and visualize images from a cat and dog dataset using TensorFlow’s preprocessing layers. Data augmentation helps improve model generalization by introducing variability into the training data, simulating real-world conditions like rotation, zoom, brightness, and more.
